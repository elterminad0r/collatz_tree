# collatz\_tree
Inspired by the Collatz conjecture. From the conjecture, one might be able to build a tree with root node 1 where all numbers feed back to 1, and any path down the tree is a Collatz path. Featuring a command-line script to generate (and draw a very pretty unicode picture of) a collatz tree, and a Processing file that draws an even prettier tree, where a `3n + 1` step goes left, and an `n / 2` step goes right, featuring some rainbow HSB colouring. If the Collatz conjecture is disproven, this program might not work.
